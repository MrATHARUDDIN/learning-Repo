ðŸ§© What is a Module in Python?
A module is a file containing Python code (functions, classes, variables) 
that you can reuse in other Python programs.

Think of it like a toolbox. Instead of writing everything from scratch,
 you can just import a module and use its tools (functions).

                                ðŸ§© Types of Modules
 ðŸ”¹ Built-in modules
Already included with Python â€” no need to install.
Examples: time, math, random, os

 ðŸ”¹External modules
You install them using pip (Pythonâ€™s package manager).
Example: numpy, pandas, flask

 ðŸ”¹ Custom modules
Your own .py files with reusable code.
