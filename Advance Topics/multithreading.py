# Multithreading ðŸ§µ is a concept in computer programming where a single process is divided into multiple threads 
# that can run concurrently (at the same time). 
# Itâ€™s commonly used to make programs faster and more efficient, especially when doing tasks that can happen in parallel.

#      ðŸ§  What is a Thread?
#           A thread is the smallest unit of a process that can be scheduled by the operating system.


# ðŸ”§ Why use multithreading?
# âœ… Improves performance on multi-core CPUs.

# âœ… Better resource utilization.

# âœ… Responsive user interfaces (UI doesn't freeze).

# âœ… Faster execution for tasks like downloading files, real-time games, etc.





# we gonna use it for featching apis

# Wait for all threads to complete before moving on
# `.join()` blocks the main program until the thread finishes
